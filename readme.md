# MEHN Books, Movies, and TV Shows
General Assembly SEI August 28 - Project 2


- Project: https://github.com/Sundeem7/movies.git
- Project Board: https://github.com/Sundeem7/movies/projects/1

## Overview
The goal of this project was to use the MEHN Template, Mongoose, and Handlebars to render ERD in the browser. I chose to create a library of my favorite tv shows, movies and books. Each category has a one to many relationship.


## CRUD
1. Click the category of your choice (Books, Movies, or TV Show)
2. Click the "+" symbol to create a new entry
3. A title is required, however, additonal categories are optional
4. Once created, the library item will show on the main category page
5. Edits can be made by clicking the "EDIT" button
6. The form for editing also includes a delete option
7. You may get back to the Home Screen by click the "Contented Catalouge in the top left corener of the screen"
